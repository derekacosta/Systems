LC3 Simulators, Assemblers and C Compiler.
===========================

P&P textbook's web site, student materials:

You will need the unix version of the assembler and C compiler
by Steven Lumetta.  Or see ../src/lc3tools_v12.zip.  It Contains 
sources and makefiles to build,

    a. lc3as: a commandline LC3 assembler produces
      1. foo.obj, an LC3 machine code object file.
      2. foo.sym, the symbol table

    b. lc3sim: commandline LC3 simulator, 
       reads .obj files, simulates LC3 execution.
       I recommend PennSim.jar instead.

    c. lc3convert: a commandline translator.
       Takes .bin input and produces .obj output. The .bin input can be 
       binary-coded text (-b2) or hex-coded text (-b16).

See usage documentation for these below.
Also includes lc3os.asm: an lc3 operating system (or see ../src/).


=========================
Other course sites, documentation 
=========================

CIS, U Penn, Diana Palsetia et alia.
Contains an lc3 assembler/simulator written in Java, PennSim.jar.
Uses a version of the lc3 which includes a MCR (machine control reg), 
MPR (memory protection reg), TMR/TMI (timer), and memory-mapped video 
RAM. The simulator's version of the lc3 ISA also includes an instruction 
that sets user/supervisor mode, jumpt.  Site also has source code for an OS 
for the lc3. The OS code can be easily edited to convert it to standard lc3 ISA.

Misc. info:
========================

End-of-lines, unix/dos/apple

    MS Windows, DOS: x0D x0A 
    (aka: CR LF,  \r \f, ^13 ^10, ^M ^J, 0x0D 0x0A)

   Apple Macintosh OS 9 and earlier: x0D (CR)

   Unix (e.g., Linux), also Apple OS X and higher: x0A (LF)


====================================
LC3 tools, unix version (Lumetta)
====================================
Build using gcc (see README in lc3tools-v12.zip distribution).

Contents:
--- lc3as:        LC3 assembler, produces .obj files.
--- lc3convert:   ascii to .obj converter.


-------------------------
-------------------------
lc3as, usage
-------------------------
-------------------------

Assembles LC3 assembly source code to an .obj file.

Command            ---- Description 
-------------      ---------------------------
lc3as file.asm     ---- Creates file.obj and file.sym, the symbol table. 

Error Message                      ---- Explanation
------------------------           ---------------------------
file contains only comments        ---- no assembly instructions in file.
no .ORIG or .END directive found   ---- .ORIG/.END must be first/last line.
multiple .ORIG directives found    ---- one .ORIG is allowed per file. 
instruction appears before .ORIG   ---- instructions must start after .ORIG.
no .END directive found            ---- all programs must end with .END. 
label appears before .ORIG         ---- nothing should appear before .ORIG.
label has already appeared         ---- label can only be defined once.
unknown label x                    ---- label x is referenced, but not defined. 
illegal operands for x             ---- instruction has bad operand specification. 
unterminated string                ---- .STRINGZ has no close-quotes.
contains unrecognizable characters ---- found chars that assembler cannot parse. 
WARNING: All text after .END is ignored.


---------------------------
---------------------------
lc3convert, usage
---------------------------
---------------------------

Convert ascii text version of a machine code .obj file to 
an actual executable machine code .obj file that can be 
run in the simulator.  As with the actual lc3 .obj format,
the first line must contain the load address of 
the first instruction: if the first line is

    0011 0000 0000 0000

then the first instruction will be located at x3000 when running 
the simulator. Since lc3convert is reading plain text files, it
can handle some extras: (1) the ";" comment character
causes the rest of the line to be ignored, (2) digits may have white
space within them to help visually group them.

Command                     ---- Description 
-----------------           ---------------------------
lc3convert file.bin         ---- create file.obj, which can be run by simulator.
lc3convert -b2 file.bin     ---- machine code is text in binary (base 2). 
lc3convert -b16 file.bin    ---- machine code is text in hex (base 16). 

Error Message                      ---- Explanation
----------------------             ---------------------------
line contains only x digits        ---- only x digits of 16-bit instruction found.
line contains more than 16 digits  ---- instruction bigger than 16-bits.
contains unrecognizable characters ---- invalid characters were used.
constant outside of allowed range  ---- Immediate value exceeds instruction's range.
